 ### Question/Answer
```
1)
Weak encryption algorithm: DES
Replace DES with AES, which is more secure and modern.
FLAG{weak_des_not_recommended}

2)
Vulnerable encryption mode: ECB
Switch from ECB mode to CBC or GCM, which hide patterns in the data.
FLAG{ecb_mode_reveals_patterns}

3)
Padding oracle vulnerability exists in the decryption process where error messages reveal information about padding
Implement constant time padding validation and use generic error messages that don't reveal padding information
FLAG{padding_oracle_vulnerability}

4)
Key reuse across multiple messages allows attackers to perform cryptanalysis by comparing ciphertexts encrypted with the same key
Use unique keys for each encryption operation and implement proper key rotation policies
FLAG(key_reuse_danger}

5)
